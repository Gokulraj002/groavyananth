                <strong>Stable income:</strong> Management of farms implies that
                there are steady revenues which are obtained from rental
                tenancies as well as from sales of crops. It has been stated
                that the management's responsibility is also to utilize the land
                in the most effective way so that productivity and profitability
                are achieved.This is considerable income and can help one make a
                lot of money especially in fiscal hardships such as a
                recessionary period.
              </Paragraph>

                <strong>Land value appreciation:</strong>The next one is the
                land, especially the farmland which, unlike the built-up land,
                gradually escalates in value. As demand in the sustainability of
                food and agricultural management increases the cost of farmland
                will also be higher. This appreciation can play a major role in
                accruing large amounts of wealth for landowners in the future.

              <Paragraph>
                <strong>Diversify investment portfolio:</strong> Purchasing
                managed farmland helps to diversify the investment portfolio,
                decrease the risks and enhance the portfolio's resilience.
                Farmland is a preferred form of investment as compared to stocks
                and bonds because its investment portfolio does not fluctuate
                drastically. They use it as an inflation and market risk hedge,
                thus being a safe haven investment.
