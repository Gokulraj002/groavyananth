          <h2 className="mt-3">Key ROI Benefits of Agricultural Land</h2>

          <p className="para-color3">
            <b>Increased Value:</b> Agricultural land, especially in regions near
            tourist hotspots like <b>Nandi Hills</b> and <b>Lepakshi</b>,
            consistently appreciates. This means your investment will naturally
            grow over time due to increasing land demand and market trends.
            Furthermore, land near urban areas is becoming increasingly scarce,
            further enhancing its value. Many investors have seen annual returns
            of 8-12% in these areas, driven by both land scarcity and rising
            demand for agricultural produce.
          </p>

          <p className="para-color3">
            <b>Multiple Revenue Streams:</b> Farmland can generate income through
            agricultural activities, agritourism, and leasing opportunities.
            Managed farmlands, like <b>Elegant Orchards Estate</b>, provide
            hassle-free management, so you can reap the financial benefits without
            constant involvement. You can diversify your investment by growing

            your income potential.
